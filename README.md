### üëã About Me

I am an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer and Systems Engineering at Alexandria University. My passion lies in Software Engineering, where I am keen to apply emerging technologies and contribute to innovative projects. With a strong foundation in Java, C/C++, and Python, I have honed my problem-solving skills through academic projects and participation in coding competitions like ECPC.

Currently, I am working on developing a **Breast Cancer Detection Model**. This project leverages deep learning techniques to identify malignant and benign tumors, with the potential to make a significant impact in the field of medical diagnostics.
